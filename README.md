# Heal-Images-OpenCV
A python code attached with a used image, which is damaged and we will attempt to heal it.

Note that there are different types of damages that we can have and this code might not work properly on some types.
Technically this is suitable for cases that something has been drawn or put on image (on rather a small area).
